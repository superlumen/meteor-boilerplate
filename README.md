# Meteor 1.3 stack by superlumen

We use React and related packages.
We try to install most packages through npm. No need for wrapper packages (atmosphere).

## Basics

* Meteor 1.4 with npm and modules
* React
* Redux
* Apollo (GraphQL)

## Structure

See the [Meteor Guide](http://guide.meteor.com/) for the recommended code layout conventions.

Check out the [superlumen naming conventions](https://github.com/superlumen/knowledge/wiki/Naming-Conventions) doc. It's a good starting point to follow.

## How to start the app?

To start the app, run `npm start` in the root folder.
